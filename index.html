            <p>While interning at Secure64 for roughly half a year, I focused on building quality assurance tests for the existing products. I collaborated with coworkers to figure out how the DNS server products Secure64 made worked, then made automated tests for each component. I contributed to an existing test harness by adding a stress test module, got knowledge of how DNS servers work through trial and error, and resolved numerous defects in the product line.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <p>This project was made over a semester with different partners in my Web Development class at CSU. I helped make this website from scratch starting with just HTML and CSS. The site was an imitation produce store website. As the project progressed, we used PHP to implement a user login system into the website along with the option for users to reset their passwords via email. Users who logged on to the site could add food to their cart and even comment on the pages they visited which was implemented using SQLite. By the end we used AJAX and jQuery to create web pages dynamically by pulling data from the websites of other people in the class.</p>

                <p>In May of 2017 I traveled to Russia with a group from my campus ministry at CSU to share the love of Jesus Christ with ethnic Muslims. I traveled to Pyatigorsk and went to a linguistic university to interact with the students. I don't know how to speak Russian so it was good that most of the students we spoke with knew enough English to get by. We got to share the gospel with the people there and plant seeds that others will get to sow in the future.

              <p class="subtitle"><b>Class in Ecuador</b></p>
              <div class="content">
                <p>From January 1-14 2018 I traveled to Ecuador with a group of students from the College of Business at CSU. We toured around 13 different cities in Ecuador. We started in Quito, a big city, and from there traveled through many rural towns. We went to a school for troubled children and helped them out by painting walls and playground equipment. I even got to teach English to a class of Spanish speaking students, or at least I attempted to teach them as I don't know Spanish... We got to see the many beautiful volcanoes of Ecuador and walk the equator line. At one point we visited a chocolate processing plant to see how they run things. We saw the process of drying out cocoa beans to make them into the chocolate we all know. We went to another factory to see how workers package chocolate and a small chocolate business owner's perspective on Hershey's chocolate and the state of chocolate business in the world. This class gave me the last credit I needed to graduate and I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone to experience it. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/peterecuador/home">Here</a> is a link to the blog I wrote about the experience.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <p>This project was made in my Software Engineering class at CSU. At the beginning of the class we formed teams of three to make a project with for the rest of the semester. Using Java and Git/Github we made a program that would take a CSV file with a list destinations in Colorado and create an XML itinerary and an SVG map showing a route to take, connecting each destination. As the project went on, it was adapted to take input from an SQL database containing thousands of locations across the world and output a KML file that is compatible with Google Earth. The user could choose what exact destinations they wanted using a GUI and even use optional constraints to find the shortest trip.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <p>I enjoy making websites (like this one) and learning the mechanics of the websites we use everyday.</p>
                <p>I read the Bible often and it always keep me entertained and pushing to never stay complacent in my life.</p>
                <p>I like using Linux and increasing my understanding of how linux kernels work. I find all the different distros and desktop environments fascinating.</p>
                <p>Playing video games is something I've always enjoyed (especially the new legend of zelda).</p>
